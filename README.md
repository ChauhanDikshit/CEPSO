# 🚚 CEPSO: A Feasibility Restoration Particle Swarm Optimizer with Chaotic Maps for Two-Stage Fixed-Charge Transportation Problems  
📄 Published in *Swarm and Evolutionary Computation* (Elsevier)

## 📌 About the Project

**CEPSO** is a novel optimization algorithm designed to solve the **two-stage non-linear fixed-charge transportation problem (NFCTP)**—a complex and **NP-hard** problem. In NFCTP, each arc incurs both fixed and variable costs, where the variable cost increases quadratically with the transported units. This results in significant computational challenges, especially in large-scale scenarios.

To tackle this, CEPSO introduces several key innovations:

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Feasibility Restoration Mechanism**  
  Ensures solution feasibility using:
  - Constraint compliance adjustment  
  - Ratio adjustment procedures  

- **Non-linear Adaptive Parameters**  
  Introduces adaptive **inertia weight** and **acceleration coefficients** to enhance exploration and exploitation capabilities throughout the optimization process.

- **Chaotic Acceleration Coefficients**  
  Integrates **10 chaotic maps** into the acceleration coefficients, increasing diversity and avoiding premature convergence.

## 🧪 Experimental Evaluation

- Tested on both **small** and **large-scale** NFCTPs (ranging from **35 to 1044 dimensions**).
- Compared against multiple PSO variants using standard performance metrics.
- Results confirm **CEPSO’s superior optimization performance** and feasibility assurance, especially in high-dimensional cases.
