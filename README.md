## üìå About the Project

**CEPSO** is a novel optimization algorithm designed to solve the **two-stage non-linear fixed-charge transportation problem (NFCTP)**‚Äîa complex and **NP-hard** problem. In NFCTP, each arc incurs both fixed and variable costs, where the variable cost increases quadratically with the transported units. This results in significant computational challenges, especially in large-scale scenarios.

To tackle this, CEPSO introduces several key innovations:

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Feasibility Restoration Mechanism**  
  Ensures solution feasibility using:
  - Constraint compliance adjustment  
  - Ratio adjustment procedures  

- **Non-linear Adaptive Parameters**  
  Introduces adaptive **inertia weight** and **acceleration coefficients** to enhance exploration and exploitation capabilities throughout the optimization process.

- **Chaotic Acceleration Coefficients**  
  Integrates **10 chaotic maps** into the acceleration coefficients, increasing diversity and avoiding premature convergence.

## üß™ Experimental Evaluation

- Tested on both **small** and **large-scale** NFCTPs (ranging from **35 to 1044 dimensions**).
- Compared against multiple PSO variants using standard performance metrics.
- Results confirm **CEPSO‚Äôs superior optimization performance** and feasibility assurance, especially in high-dimensional cases.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

> üí° **Requirements**: MATLAB R2018 or later recommended.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChauhanDikshit/CEPSO.git
   cd CEPSO
   ```

2. **Open `main_CEPSO.m`** in MATLAB.

3. **Run the main script**:
   ```matlab
   main_CEPSO
   ```

4. **Modify problem instances or parameters** inside the script as needed:
   - Change the number of particles
   - Choose a different chaotic map
   - Adjust stopping criteria, dimensions, etc.

## üìä Results Visualization (Optional)

The code generates plots such as:

- **Convergence Curves** (objective value vs. iteration)
- **Feasibility ratio**
- **Comparison of chaotic maps**

> You can customize plotting functions in `plot_results.m`.
